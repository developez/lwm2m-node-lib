- Set Nodejs 8 as minimum version in packages.json (effectively removing Nodev6 from supported versions)
- Device type can now be taken from the uri query parameter type. e.g. with this url /rd?ep=endpoint&lt=300&b=U&type=Type
 the device type will be Type if the type is defined in config.js. In this way, other lwm2m client implementations in
 which the URI-Path is not configurable can use the Device type functionality.
