- Set Nodejs 8 as minimum version in packages.json (effectively removing Nodev6 from supported versions)
- Device type can now be taken from the uri query parameter type. e.g. with this url /rd?ep=endpoint&lt=300&b=U&type=Type
 the device type will be Type if the type is defined in config.js. In this way, other lwm2m client implementations in
 which the URI-Path is not configurable can use the Device type functionality.
- defaultAcceptFormat variable added to config.js (equivalent to LWM2M_DEFAULT_ACCEPT_FORMAT env var). This variable allows the user to control the Accept header value
for read and observe server sent requests. This header can be useful when the server needs to specify an specific
content-format to properly interoperate with the connected clients.
- LWM2M_WRITE_FORMAT env var as equivalence of config.writeFormat
- Upgrade mongoose dependency from 5.3.10 to 5.7.7 due to security
